There is this awesome script which emulates a tiling WM in KDE. It's called Krohnkite.
Go to plasma system settings > Kwin Scripts and click on install script.
Search for tiling and select Krohnkite. It emulates a tiling WM like i3/dwm

You can customize shortcuts by changing them in the shortcuts section of plasma settings.
These are present under Kwin shortcuts.

You can even enable gaps and change a bunch of settings, but you have to first run these commands in the terminal:
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/ 
  ln -s ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/krohnkite/metadata.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/krohnkite.desktop

Changes made are reflected only after a logout & re-login.

This script is also crazy efficient and doesn't affects RAM performance. My startup RAM usage is only ~490 MB.

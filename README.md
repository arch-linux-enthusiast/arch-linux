# arch-linux
Hello I am a student fairly new to Linux and programming in general.
I am interested mainly in Arch Linux,Python,Bash and giving up on all technology to go live in the woods in that specific order.
This repository is dedicated to my personal recommended configuration and dotfiles for a vanilla Arch Linux Install with the KDE desktop environment.
This repository serves more as a basic guide for me and is not intended for anyone else.<br/>

**I have licensed this under the GPL v3 so if you do follow this, you do it at your own risk.** There is no guarantee from my side. <br/>

I shall not be held responsible for broken computers, corrupted installs, depression, ending of your personal relationships or thermonuclear wars.<br/>
If you do blame me I will sit with a large bucket of popcorn and enjoy watching your life crumble in front of me while doing nothing about it.
(LOL I love the last two lines, it is inspired from XDA Developers' forums)<br/>

Also in case you are wondering, I like Beethoven more than Mozart. Moonlight Sonata is probably the piece I have enjoyed the most.
